1)Inheritence

package NewProject;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class Practies {

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		Iphone6 i6=new Iphone6();
		i6.Cemara();
		i6.Phone();
		Iphone7 i7=new Iphone7();
		i7.Network();
		i7.Cemara();
		i7.Phone();
		Iphone8 i8=new Iphone8();
		i8.Cemara();
	}

}
//Inhertence
class Iphone6{
	void Cemara() {
		System.out.println("This is 8Px camera");
	}
	void Phone() {
		System.out.println("This is dailpad");
	}
	void Network() {
		System.out.println("This is 3g network");
	}
}
//single level inheretence
class Iphone7 extends Iphone6{
	void Network() {
		System.out.println("This is 4g network");
	}
}
//Multi level Inheritence
class Iphone8 extends Iphone7{
	
}



2)Polymorphisam
a)Method overrideing
package NewProject;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class Practies {

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		Iphone6 i6=new Iphone6();
		i6.Cemara();
		i6.Phone();
		Iphone7 i7=new Iphone7();
		i7.Network();
		i7.Cemara();
		i7.Phone();
		
	}

}
//Inhertence
class Iphone6{
	void Cemara() {
		System.out.println("This is 8Px camera");
	}
	void Phone() {
		System.out.println("This is dailpad");
	}
	void Network() {
		System.out.println("This is 3g network");
	}
}
// Method overriding
class Iphone7 extends Iphone6{
	void Cemara() {
		System.out.println("This is 16Px camera");
	}
}

b) method overloading
class Math{
	void Add(int a,int b) {
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}
	void Add(int a,int b,int c) {
		System.out.println(a+b+c);
	}
	void Add(float a,float b,float c) {
		System.out.println(a+b+c);
	}
}
